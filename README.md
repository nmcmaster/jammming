App made for final project of Codecademy "Build Web Applications From Scratch", which allows you to search Spotify for songs (once signed in) and create playlists featuring those songs. The CSS/design is Codecademy's, not mine. This is not a project I'm currently updating, but it didn't seem worth tearing this repo down.
